          The Straw Hat Pirates have been on the sea for about 3 weeks and for about 2 of those weeks, they ran out of food from their captain. 
          They tried fishing but either didn't get a bit or the caption ate it before the rest.
          Thanks to their caption, there is no more fish in the sea.
          Please help by donating to them. We will send food to them when found.
